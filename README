# Run this script in a terminal. It displays activity statistics 
# from the last 24 hours, like this:
#
# 2m 55s        Google Chrome
# 2m 51s        TextMate
# 1m 7s         Terminal
# 37s           Colloquy
# 
# Time spent at your computer: 7m 30s
# Total time tracked: 7m 30s
# 
# It detects idle time based on the screensaver, so lower your 
# screensaver delay to improve accuracy.
#
# It doesn't save the data, so if you kill the script it loses the
# history.
